\noindent \section*{Dissertation} \subsection*{{Exploration of fractional routing}}
\indent{Investigated the effects of bottlenecking within a butterfly network graph. Took an in depth look at the research paper "network routing capacity" by J.Cannons and extracted the algorithm proposed, applying it towards the network graph and examined the effects certain edges with limited capacity has on the routing capacity. Topic included a review of network coding (coding information as a function at the node) and featured strong use of linear programming within Mathematica.}
Grade A achieved with comments made by examiners praising use of critical thinking and approach to a technically hard subject.
