\noindent \section*{Dissertation} \indent \subsection*{{Exploration of fractional routing}}
\noindent{Investigated the effects of bottlenecking within a butterfly network graph. Took an in depth look at the research paper "network routing capacity" by J.Cannons and extracted the algorithm proposed towards the network graph and examined the effects certain edges with limited capacity has on the routing capacity. Featured strong use of linear programming within Mathematica.} \par
